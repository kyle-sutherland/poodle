PLANNING:
To correct the previous response and ensure the edits match the existing code exactly, I will:

1. Create a new Python file named `main_logic.py` that will contain the main logic of the application. This file will define a class `PoodleApp` that encapsulates the main application logic.
2. Move the main application logic from `poodle.py` to `main_logic.py`. This includes the `main` function and all the functions it calls, such as `send_message`, `handle_response`, `initialize_kw_detector`, `print_prompt_jo`, and any other related logic.
3. Modify `poodle.py` to act as a launcher script. It will parse command-line arguments and then create an instance of `PoodleApp` from `main_logic.py` and call its `run` method.
4. Ensure that the `PoodleApp` class in `main_logic.py` accepts a configuration object as a parameter to its constructor and uses this configuration throughout the application.
5. Update the `main` function in `poodle.py` to reflect these changes, ensuring that the end-user experience remains unchanged.

    app = PoodleApp(config)
    app.run()

```

The `main_logic.py` file will contain the core functionality of the application, while `poodle.py` will serve as the entry point that sets up the configuration and launches the application. The user experience of launching the application via the command line will remain the same.
