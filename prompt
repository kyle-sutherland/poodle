I want to improve this application by extricating as much as possible the main logic of the application from the command line interface logic. I then want to have a separate launcher script that laucnhes the application as a CLI with command line arguments the same as it is now. The end-user experience of launching the application this way should be unchanged from what it is now. The application already has a miniconda environment called 'poodle' with the currently needed dependencies installed, therefore, use this environment to run the program and use conda first to install packages, and then pip if they are unavailable via pip. The environment is already set up, so you don't need to do that, just activate it. Don't make up any directories. Leave the current files where they are. It's okay if they are all in one directory. You keep making the mistake of putting stuff in some/dir/. don't do that.
